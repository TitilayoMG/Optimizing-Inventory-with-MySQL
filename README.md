# Optimizing-Inventory-with-MySQL
Learn how I use MySQL optimization techniques to achieve optimal inventory levels.


## Introduction
This project is about supply chain and inventory issues for a company facing significant inventory management challenges. These challenges are affecting their operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. To solve these issues, there is a need to implement a sophisticated inventory optimization system using MySQL to address these business challenges effectively

## Problem Statement
Here are the business problems:

* Overstocking: There are excessive inventory of certain products
* Understocking: Conversely, high-demand products regularly suffer from stockouts
* Customer Satisfaction: Lack of customer satisfaction and loyalty due to delays, frequent stockouts and frustration when they cannot find the products they seek.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to implement a sophisticated inventory optimization system using MySQL to address TechElectro Inc. business challenges effectively

The stakeholder should be able to
* Achieve optimal inventory levels by minimizing overstock and understock situations for each product SKU (Stock Keeping Unit).
* Determine the optimal reorder point for each unique product based 
* Enable data-driven decision-making in inventory management to reduce costs and enhance customers satisfaction.
* Determine the lead time demand for each product

## Data Source
This dataset is sourced from amdari.io

## Skills and Concepts Demonstrated
* Query Optimization
* Data Manipulation
* Stored Procedures & Triggers
* Subqueries

## Data Transformation
I imported all the file into MySQL 

### Data Cleaning
I tranformed the data in MySQL, checked for Column quality and converted each column to it appropriate data type.

## Data Analysis 


## Key Analysis
* Analyze the sales trend and calculated sales stock levels based on sales reliability and lead time.
* Calculated the optimal reorder point, which is the level at which a new order should be placed.
* Automated the calculation of reorder points to avoid repeating the same process over and over again.

## Key Insights
* The initial stages of the analysis revealed significant inconsistency in inventory levels, with instances of both overstocking and understocking.
↔ These inconsistencies were contributing to capital insufficiencies and customer dissatisfaction.

* The analysis indicated that sales trends were notably influenced by various external factors.
↔ Recognizing these patterns provides an opportunity to forecast demand more accurately.

* Through the inventory optimization analysis, it was evident that the existing inventory levels were not optimized for current sales trends.
↔ Products were identified that had either excess inventory or were close to excess inventory.

## Recommendation
* Develop a systematic approach to collect and analyze feedback from various stakeholders, as this feedback is crucial for continuous improvement and alignment with business objectives.
* Regularly review these metrics to ensure they align with current market conditions.
